## About the Game

- Classic Mode: The traditional Tic Tac Toe game that everyone knows and loves.

- Alternative Mode: In every 3rd move of each player, their first move becomes faint, indicating it will disappear in the next turn. In every 4th move, the first move disappears. This makes the game more intense, interesting, and longer, requiring players to think carefully about their moves.

- Vibration Effects: Experience tactile feedback with vibration effects, adding another layer of interactivity to your gameplay.
